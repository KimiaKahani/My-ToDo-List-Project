This is a todo list project including mostly required aspects of a complete todo list.
There is an input field where the users can enter their task name. However, the name cannot be empty or repetitive.
Each task contains a checkbox to mark it as completed and a delete button.
There is an option that allows users to change the name of an existing task, subject to the condition that the new name is not empty or repetitive.
The most important aspect of my todo list project is that all tasks save to the browser's local storage, and any changes are reflected in those stored tasks.
